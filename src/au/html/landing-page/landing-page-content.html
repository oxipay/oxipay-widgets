                    <h3>What is Oxipay?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Oxipay is a flexible and secure way for you to shop today and pay over time to ensure you can have what you need now.

                    <h3>How do I sign up?</h3>
                    <p>
                        All you need is your email, mobile, be at least 18 years old, have an Australian address and your credit or debit card from
                        which payments will be deducted automatically. You can sign up on the Oxipay home page or through
                        our online checkout – just select Oxipay as your payment option.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What are the fees and charges?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Oxipay is a payment plan that is totally interest free. The only fee is a $6 late payment fee (avoidable if you pay on time).

                    <p>
                        You can spend up to $1400. Check your available balance in your Oxipay Customer Account. You decide whether you want to make
                        weekly or fortnightly payments and your payment card will be automatically charged. Your first payment
                        is charged at time of purchase. We will email your payment schedule and send reminders before payments
                        are due.
                    </p>
